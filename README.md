# FindMyKey | Bluetooth-Key-Finder-Project

---

#### KeyFinder is a mobile application designed to help users locate and manage their personal belongings, such as keys, wallets, bags, or other valuable items. The app provides a simple, intuitive, and secure interface for tracking items in real-time, minimizing the stress and time wasted when objects are misplaced.
#### This project focuses on UI/UX design, including user research, personas, wireframes, high-fidelity designs, and interactive prototypes.

## The app allows users to:

- Register and log in to their account securely.
- Add devices (key trackers) manually, by QR code, or automatically via Bluetooth.
- View all tracked devices on a dashboard, including their status and location.
- Quickly locate items using a map or a “ring” function to make the device emit a sound.
- Manage devices easily, including renaming, removing, or categorizing them.
